# 🩺 Disease Prediction from Medical Data

**Objective:** Predict the possibility of disease based on structured patient data.
**Approach:** Classification models trained on medical datasets, with full evaluation and an interactive demo.

## Datasets

| Dataset | Features | Target | Status in this project |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Breast Cancer (Wisconsin)** | 30 numeric features (cell nuclei measurements) | malignant / benign | ✅ Real data, loaded automatically via `sklearn.datasets` |
| **Heart Disease (UCI Cleveland)** | 13 features (age, sex, chest pain type, cholesterol, etc.) | disease / no disease | ⚠️ Synthetic placeholder (see below) |
| **Diabetes (Pima Indians)** | 8 features (glucose, BMI, blood pressure, etc.) | diabetic / not diabetic | ⚠️ Synthetic placeholder (see below) |

### Using the real Heart Disease / Diabetes datasets

This environment doesn't have internet access, so `heart.csv` and `diabetes.csv`
couldn't be downloaded automatically. The code **generates realistic synthetic
data with the same columns** so the whole pipeline runs today. To switch to the
real data (recommended for anything beyond a demo):

1. Download from the UCI Machine Learning Repository:
   - Heart Disease: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/45/heart+disease
   - Diabetes (Pima Indians): https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database
2. Save them as `data/heart.csv` (must have a `target` column, 1 = disease) and
   `data/diabetes.csv` (must have an `Outcome` column, 1 = diabetic).
3. Re-run `python main.py` — the loader automatically detects and uses the real files.

## Models

- **Logistic Regression** — fast, interpretable baseline
- **SVM (RBF Kernel)** — good for non-linear boundaries
- **Random Forest** — ensemble of decision trees, handles non-linearity + feature importance
- **XGBoost** — gradient boosting, usually the strongest performer on tabular data
  (falls back to scikit-learn's `GradientBoostingClassifier` automatically if
  `xgboost` isn't installed)

All models are wrapped identically so they're evaluated on the exact same
train/test split and metrics for a fair comparison.

## How to Run

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Train + evaluate all models on all 3 datasets
python main.py

# Or just one dataset
python main.py --dataset breast_cancer
python main.py --dataset heart
python main.py --dataset diabetes

# Launch the interactive prediction demo (after running main.py at least once)
streamlit run app.py
```

## What gets produced

For every (dataset × model) combination:
- Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC-AUC → `outputs/reports/<dataset>_summary.csv`
- Confusion matrix heatmap → `outputs/plots/<dataset>_<model>_confusion.png`
- Feature importance chart → `outputs/plots/<dataset>_<model>_importance.png`
- Full classification report (text) → `outputs/reports/<dataset>_<model>_report.txt`
- Trained model → `outputs/models/<dataset>_<model>.pkl`

Plus, per dataset:
- Combined ROC curve comparing all 4 models → `outputs/plots/<dataset>_roc_curves.png`
- A best-model recommendation (by F1-Score), printed to console

And overall:
- `outputs/reports/all_datasets_summary.csv` — every model/dataset combination in one table

## Example Results (this run)

Breast Cancer, being real, high-quality, well-separated data, scores highest
(~97% accuracy). Heart/Diabetes numbers are lower and more "realistic" because
they're synthetic data without a truly learnable signal — swap in the real
UCI files to get meaningful clinical results there.

See `outputs/reports/all_datasets_summary.csv` for exact numbers from this run.

## Notes on Methodology

- **Preprocessing:** duplicate rows dropped, missing values median-imputed,
  features standardized (zero mean, unit variance) before SVM/Logistic Regression
  (tree-based models don't strictly need scaling but it doesn't hurt them here).
- **Train/test split:** 80/20, stratified by target class, `random_state=42` for reproducibility.
- **Evaluation:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, ROC-AUC — precision/recall
  are reported because in medical diagnosis, false negatives (missed disease)
  and false positives (unnecessary alarm) matter differently than raw accuracy.

## Running with Docker

Instead of installing Python packages locally, you can run everything in
containers.

**1. Train the models first (one-time, or whenever you want to retrain):**
```
docker compose run --rm train
```
This trains all 3 datasets and saves models/reports to `outputs/` on your
host machine (mounted as a volume, so they persist and both the app and
API can read them).

**2. Start the web app and API:**
```
docker compose up
```
- Streamlit app → http://localhost:8501
- REST API → http://localhost:8000 (interactive docs at `/docs`)

Stop everything with `Ctrl+C`, or `docker compose down`.

**Just the app, without compose:**
```
docker build -t disease-prediction .
docker run -p 8501:8501 -v ${PWD}/outputs:/app/outputs -v ${PWD}/database:/app/database disease-prediction
```

**Deploying to the cloud:** this same image works on Render, Railway, Azure
Container Apps, or AWS (ECS/App Runner) — point them at the Dockerfile, set
the start command to the `app` or `api` service's command from
`docker-compose.yml`, and make sure a persistent volume/disk is attached at
`/app/outputs` and `/app/database` (otherwise trained models and history
disappear on every redeploy).

## CI/CD (GitHub Actions)

Every push/PR to `main` runs `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`, a three-stage
pipeline where each stage only runs if the previous one passed:

1. **Test** — installs dependencies and runs the `pytest` suite in
   `tests/` (data loading, preprocessing, model definitions, API smoke
   tests). Runs on every push and pull request.
2. **Train** — on pushes to `main` only: runs `python main.py` end-to-end
   on the breast-cancer dataset as a pipeline smoke test (with
   `CI_QUICK=1`, which shrinks the hyperparameter search so it finishes in
   about a minute instead of retraining everything at full size). Trained
   artifacts are uploaded to the Actions run for inspection.
3. **Deploy** — on pushes to `main` only: builds the Docker image from the
   existing `Dockerfile` and pushes it to GitHub Container Registry as
   `ghcr.io/<owner>/<repo>:latest` and `:<commit-sha>`, using the built-in
   `GITHUB_TOKEN` (no extra secrets to configure).

Run the same tests locally with:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
pytest tests/ -v
```

This is an educational project, not a medical device. Predictions should never
be used for actual clinical decision-making.
